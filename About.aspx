				Welcome to Tom's Bowling Alley Mississauga! We're a small family run business. 
				Our entire family has lived in Mississauga for 4 generations and we all have one thing in common,
				we love bowling! So in 2015 our founder, Tom Timmington,  set out to open his own Bowling Alley. 
				Not only was he successful but he got the whole family involved! Next time you come down to knock
				over a few pins say hello to whoevers behind the counter and we'll treat you like family. See you soon!
